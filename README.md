# About

This contains all of my implementation for different function and methods such as `map()`, `filter()` etc.

Purpose of these implementation is understand how different things works under the hood these are in no way
ready to be used in any projects. These polyfills are only for learning purposes.


## Usage

Each implementation is in a seprate file so create an `index.html` file in your local machine as it is ignored 
and use any implementation by importing a paricular script.
